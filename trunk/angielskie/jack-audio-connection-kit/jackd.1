.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBjackd\fR invokes the JACK audio server daemon.  When using JACK's
built-in support for realtime capabilities, use the \fBjackstart\fR
command, instead.  All options are the same.

JACK is a low-latency audio server, originally written for the
GNU/Linux operating system.  It can connect a number of different JACK
client applications to an audio device, and also to each other.  Most
clients are external, running in their own processes as normal
applications.  JACK also supports internal clients, which run within
the \fBjackd\fR process using a loadable "plugin" interface.

JACK differs from other audio servers in being designed from the
ground up for professional audio work.  It focuses on two key areas:
synchronous execution of all clients, and low latency operation.

For the latest JACK information, please consult the web site,

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-d, \-\-driver \fI driver \fR [ \fI driver-options \fR ] 
.br
Select the output driver.  The only \fIdriver\fR currently documented
here is \fBalsa\fR (see below).  There are additional drivers named
\fBcoreaudio\fR, \fBdummy\fR, \fBoss\fR and \fBportaudio\fR.  Examples
below show how to list their parameters.
.TP
\fB\-h, \-\-help\fR
.br
Print a brief usage message describing the main \fBjackd\fR options.
These do not include driver options, which are obtained using the
\fB\-\-help\fR option for that specific driver, instead.
.TP
\fB\-m, \-\-no\-mlock\fR
Do not attempt to lock memory, even if \fB\-\-realtime\fR.
.TP
\fB\-p, \-\-port\-max \fI n\fR
Set the maximum number of ports the JACK server can manage.  
The default value is 128.
.TP
\fB\-R, \-\-realtime\fR 
.br
Use realtime scheduling.  This is needed for reliable low-latency
performance.  It requires \fBjackd\fR to run with special scheduler
and memory allocation privileges, which may be obtained in two ways.
The first method is to run \fBjackd\fR with root privileges, which
means that all JACK clients must also run as root.  The second method
requires a kernel with "POSIX draft capabilities" enabled (see the
\fB<linux/capability.h>\fR include file).  Then, an ordinary user can
invoke the daemon using \fBjackstart\fR, and later launch JACK clients
without running as root.
.TP
\fB\-P, \-\-realtime\-priority \fIint\fR
When running \fB\-\-realtime\fR, set the scheduler priority to
\fIint\fR.
.TP
\fB\-\-silent\fR
Silence any output during operation.
.TP
\fB\-T, \-\-temporary\fR
Exit once all clients have closed their connections.
.TP
\fB\-t, \-\-timeout \fIint\fR
.br
Set client timeout limit in microseconds.  The default is 500 msec
when not in realtime mode (see: \-R).
.TP
\fB\-u, \-\-unlock\fR
.br
Unlock libraries GTK+, QT, FLTK, Wine.
.TP
\fB\-v, \-\-verbose\fR
Give verbose output.
.TP
\fB\-V, \-\-version\fR
Print the current JACK version number and exit.
.SS ALSA DRIVER OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-C, \-\-capture\fR [ \fIname\fR ]
Provide only capture ports, unless combined with \-D or \-P.  Optionally set 
capture device name.
.TP
\fB\-d, \-\-device \fIname\fR
.br
The ALSA pcm device \fIname\fR to use.  If none is specified, JACK will
use "hw:0", the first hardware card defined in \fB/etc/modules.conf\fR.
.TP
\fB\-z, --dither [rectangular,triangular,shaped,none]
Set dithering mode.  If \fBnone\fR or unspecified, dithering is off.
Only the first letter of the mode name is required.
.TP
\fB\-D, \-\-duplex\fR
Provide both capture and playback ports.  Defaults to on unless only one 
of \-P or \-C is specified.
.TP
\fB\-h, \-\-help\fR Print a brief usage message describing only the
\fBalsa\fR driver options.
.TP
\fB\-M, \-\-hwmeter\fR
.br
Enable hardware metering for devices that support it.  Otherwise, use
software metering.
.TP
\fB\-H, \-\-hwmon\fR
.br
Enable hardware monitoring of capture ports.  This is a method for
obtaining "zero latency" monitoring of audio input.  It requires
support in hardware and from the underlying ALSA device driver.

When enabled, requests to monitor capture ports will be satisfied by
creating a direct signal path between audio interface input and output
connectors, with no processing by the host computer at all.  This
offers the lowest possible latency for the monitored signal.

Presently (March 2003), only the RME Hammerfall series and cards based
on the ICE1712 chipset (M-Audio Delta series, Terratec, and others)
support \fB\-\-hwmon\fR.  In the future, some consumer cards may also
be supported by modifying their mixer settings.

Without \fB\-\-hwmon\fR, port monitoring requires JACK to read audio
into system memory, then copy it back out to the hardware again,
imposing the basic JACK system latency determined by the
\fB\-\-period\fR and \fB\-\-nperiods\fR options.
.TP
\fB\-i, \-\-inchannels \fIint\fR
.br
Number of capture channels.  Default is maximum supported by hardware.
.TP
\fB\-n, \-\-nperiods \fIint\fR
.br
Specify the number of periods in the hardware buffer.  The default is
2.  The period size (\fB\-p\fR) times \fB\-\-nperiods\fR times four is
the JACK buffer size in bytes.  The JACK output latency in seconds is
\fB\-\-nperiods\fR times \fB\-\-period\fR divided by \fB\-\-rate\fR.
.TP
\fB\-o, \-\-outchannels \fIint\fR
.br
Number of playback channels.  Default is maximum supported by hardware.
.TP
\fB\-P, \-\-playback\fR [ \fIname\fR ]
Provide only playback ports, unless combined with \-D or \-C.  Optionally set 
playback device name.
.TP
\fB\-p, \-\-period \fIint\fR
.br
Specify the number of frames between JACK \fBprocess()\fR calls.  The
default is 1024.  If you need low latency, set \fB\-p\fR as low as you
can go without seeing xruns.  A larger period size yields higher
latency, but makes xruns less likely.  The JACK input latency in
seconds is \fB\-\-period\fR divided by \fB\-\-rate\fR.
.TP
\fB\-r, \-\-rate \fIint\fR
Specify the sample rate.  The default is 48000.
.TP
\fB\-S, \-\-shorts
.br
Try to configure card for 16-bit samples first, only trying 32-bits if
unsuccessful.  Default is to prefer 32-bit samples.
.TP
\fB\-s, \-\-softmode\fR 
.br
Ignore xruns reported by the ALSA driver.  This makes JACK less likely
to disconnect unresponsive ports when running without
\fB\-\-realtime\fR.

.PP
Run the JACK daemon with realtime priority using the first ALSA
hardware card defined in \fB/etc/modules.conf\fR.  This must be run on
a kernel with capabilities enabled.
.IP 
\fBjackstart \-\-realtime \-\-driver=alsa\fR
.PP
Run the JACK daemon with low latency giving verbose output, which can
be helpful for trouble-shooting system latency problems.  A reasonably
well-tuned current-generation system with a decent sound card and a
low-latency kernel with capabilities enabled can handle these values
reliably.  Some can do better.  If you get xrun messages, try a larger
buffer.  Tuning a system for low latency is challenging.  The JACK
FAQ, <\fBhttp://jackit.sourceforge.net/docs/faq.php\fR> has some
useful suggestions.
.IP 
\fBjackstart \-Rv \-d alsa \-p 128 \-n 3 \-r 44100\fR
.PP
Run \fBjackd\fR with realtime priority using the "sblive" ALSA device
defined in ~/.asoundrc.  Apply shaped dithering to playback audio.
This must be run as root.
.IP 
\fBjackd \-R \-d alsa \-d sblive \-\-dither=shaped\fR
.PP
Run \fBjackd\fR with no special privileges using the second ALSA
hardware card defined in \fB/etc/modules.conf\fR.  Any xruns reported
by the ALSA driver will be ignored.  The larger buffer helps reduce
data loss.  Rectangular dithering will be used for playback.
.IP 
\fBjackd \-d alsa \-d hw:1 \-p2048 \-n3 \-\-softmode \-zr\fR
.PP
Run \fBjackd\fR in full-duplex mode using the ALSA hw:0,0 device for 
playback and the hw:0,2 device for capture.
.IP 
\fBjackd \-d alsa \-P hw:0,0 \-C hw:0,2\fR
.PP
Run \fBjackd\fR in playback-only mode using the ALSA hw:0,0 device. 
.IP 
\fBjackd \-d alsa \-P hw:0,0\fR
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.br
JACK is evolving a mechanism for automatically starting the server
when needed.  Any client started without a running JACK server will
attempt to start one itself using the command line found in the first
line of \fB$HOME/.jackdrc\fR if it exists, or \fB/etc/jackdrc\fR if it
does not.  If neither file exists, a built-in default command will be
used, including the \fB-T\fR flag, which causes the server to shut
down when all clients have exited.

As a transition, this only happens when \fB$JACK_START_SERVER\fR is
defined in the environment of the calling process.  In the future this
will become normal behavior.  In either case, defining
\fB$JACK_NO_START_SERVER\fR disables this feature.
